# Ember Discography

A discography CRUD web application written in Ember/Javascript. Store musical artists, albums, and songs.

## Reference
See the [wiki](https://github.com/adamkendis/ember-discography/wiki) for API reference.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Google Chrome](https://google.com/chrome/)

## Setup

    # Clone the code repository.
      git clone https://github.com/adamkendis/ember-discography.git
      cd ember-discography

    # Install dependencies.
      npm install

## Running
    
    # Start development server
      ember serve
      
## Using the app

With the development server running, point your browser to http://localhost:4200/

**Note:**       
The back-end is a Mirage mock server. The mock database is seeded with random artists/albums/songs on first page visit. Navigating the app via the Header links will operate on the same data set. Refreshing the page (via browser refresh button or cmd+r) will create a new mock dataset.
